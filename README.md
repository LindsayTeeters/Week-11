# Week 11 Challenge

## Overview
 Dana is a huge sci-fi fan. She loves everything about UFOs. She has a website that lists out UFO sightings. She reached out and asked for my help to create a more in-depth website. She wanted to give her viewers more details about each siting. This way the views can become more knowledgable. Dana hopes this will create a more credible website for research purposes.

## Results
 I was able to create a table that contained that relevant details for each sighting. These detials are broken out into categories and are listed as the headers of the tables. On the left hand of the screen, Filter search can be utilized. This tool can be utilized to search for sightings by key detials of Date, City and State. To use this tool, it's simple to enter im the desired information (i.e date or location). A comment section is included within the sightings table. This give important detials on what was included during each siting. This will give a wealth of knowldge to Dan's viewers for when they go UFO hunting.

  ## Summary
  
 The updates that have been made to the site have been helpful; however, they are not perfect. This site is connected to javascript data table. If new sightings are added, we would need to manually add the new sightings to our data table. It would be helpful to connected it to an open source document that can be updated as new sightings come in. THis way the website would update when its refreshed with new data. This would be a simple fix if Dana wishes to proceed in this direction. Another item that would be helpful to add for spotters to have available would be pictures of each siting, if available. Incorpoarating a visual is always helpful. Another helpful detial to add to this table would the number of times UFOs have been spotted at the locations. It can currently be captured by filtering on counting each time it shows up wihtin the filtered table.
