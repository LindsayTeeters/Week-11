# Week 11 Challenge

## Overview
 Dana is a huge sci-fi fan. She loves everything about UFOs. She has a website that lists out UFO sightings. She reached out and asked for my help to create a more in-depth website. She wanted to give her viewers more details about each siting. This way the views can become more knowledgable. Dana hopes this will create a more credible website for research purposes.

## Results
 I was able to create a table that contained that relevant details for each sighting. These detials are broken out into categories and are listed as the headers of the tables. On the left hand of the screen, Filter search can be utilized. This tool can be utilized to search for sightings by key detials of Date, City and State. To use this tool, it's simple to enter im the desired information (i.e date or location). A comment section is included within the sightings table. This give important detials on what was included during each siting. This will give a wealth of knowldge to Dan's viewers for when they go UFO hunting.
